Computer scientists resolve issues regarding technology. They use a scripting language that allows them to create programs, or applications that allow end users to navigate these applications as they see fit. They not only create these programs, but they also solve the ongoing issues that develop within them.

I look at solving problems as first indeifying the problem. Knowing what is causing the issue. I then try to understand the "why" as it is happening. I them try to form a solution. Once I have formed a solution, I attempt to implement it. Once it has been implemented, a lot of testing then takes place to ensure it operates effectivley to solve the issue and better the environment.

My ethical responsibility is to ensure the end user gets the absolute best experience possible when using my applciation for website. It is my duty to ensure that our applcation runs without issues, and their data/information is protected. It is also my duty to be proactive so that I can resolve any issues before the end user knows anything has happened.
